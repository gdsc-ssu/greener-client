## Blue to Green, GREEN’ER

### Introduction

Depression is an indispensable serious disease in modern society. The number of patients with depression is steadily increasing, especially after COVID-19. Social distancing has been prolonged due to COVID-19, and the social atmosphere of feeling frustrated and depressed has also spread due to the unknown end of COVID-19.

GREEN’ER is an emotion journal application that helps us identify and resolve our emotions. When you write an emotional diary, vague emotions become a little clearer, and you feel more refreshed, and you can exclude irrational thoughts by tracking "thinking," the cause of emotions.

### Features

    - “What happened today?” : reminds you of your day
    - “What do you think?” : a build-up question to elicit emotions
    - “So how did you feel?” : an important question in our service, allowing us to record our emotions
    - “How did you behave?” : asks you to record whether you have solved the problem
    - “How was the result?” : ends the day with this question
- Gratitude Journal
    
    Gratitude journal is a journal that contains your happy or thankful things, and this makes you realize that there are positive things too with your nightmare-like day.

    You can check content curated based on emotions on the main screen. These contents allow you to bring new positive emotions based on your own emotions.
    
- Mark as Green
    
    We can let you mark this ‘blue’ to ‘green’. This means ‘green’ color can be a certificate of your ‘emotional’ victory, through covering the blue inside.
    

### Technology

- React Native, Expo
    
    React Native is a cross-platform mobile application framework, which is based on JavaScript library ‘React’. We use Expo, which helps us to use React Native more friendly and to focus main logics, not native codes.
    
- Atomic Design
    
    Atomic Design is methodology for creating design systems, which explains a structure of components as relation of inclusion. The basic component is ‘atom’, and several atoms merge into ‘molecule’s, ‘organism’s, ‘template’s, and ‘page’s. We used components as ‘pure component’, which should not have any side effects, except ‘page’, to make UI test(by ‘Storybook’) easy.
